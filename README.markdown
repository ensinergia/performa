## Office management of performance
  Our new rails project, with **BDD, Steak, PaperTrail, Remotipart**
* [vidriloco](https://github.com/vidriloco) in charge.

### List of TODOS

1. Encapsulate notify_to to a module and mixin it with models 
2. Start thinking about a pack of specs for Notification to users involving views and logic code 
3. Make more specs for comments with commentable models; that is not yet covered (at least not for a generic model of a model)
4. Refactor analysis_controller#create 
5. Encapsulate new_with_user method to a module
6. Change get buttons to links (i.e swot#index)
7. Improve modularity of comments event more. One partial for new/edit comments functionality in any model
8. Standardize comment view links to helper functions (improve existent ones) as well as spec helper functions that test this views
9. DRY some controller actions (creed controlers)
10.Restructure localization organization for more semantic locale files
